          base_adjustment: +6  # Weight provides +6 at 215 lbs

            6'7": 0   # 89 + 6 + 0 = 95 (shown as +6 in UI)
            6'8": +2  # 89 + 6 + 2 = 97 (shown as +8 in UI)

            6'10": +4 # 89 + 6 + 4 = 99 (shown as +10 in UI)

# Notes:
# - Weight provides a base adjustment of +6 at 215 lbs
# - Wingspan provides additional incremental bonuses
# - UI shows cumulative adjustment (weight + wingspan)
# - Final cap = base_cap + weight_adjustment + wingspan_adjustment
# 
# Examples:
#   6'7" H, 215 lbs, 6'7" WS  -> 89 + 6 + 0  = 95 (UI: +6)
#   6'7" H, 215 lbs, 6'8" WS  -> 89 + 6 + 2  = 97 (UI: +8)
#   6'7" H, 215 lbs, 6'9" WS  -> 89 + 6 + 3  = 98 (UI: +9)
#   6'7" H, 215 lbs, 6'10" WS -> 89 + 6 + 4  = 99 (UI: +10)
