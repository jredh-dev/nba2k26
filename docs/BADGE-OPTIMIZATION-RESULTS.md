| 1 | 6'10" | 7'2" | 220 lbs | 34 | OPTIMAL - moderate wingspan, light weight |
| 2 | 6'10" | 7'0" | 220 lbs | 34 | Neutral wingspan |
| 3 | 6'10" | 6'10" | 220 lbs | 34 | Even wingspan |
| 4 | 6'9" | 7'1" | 260 lbs | 34 | Shorter, heavier |

### Comparison: Taller Build (7'0" / 7'4" / 260 lbs)

**Attributes:**
```
Finishing attributes slightly lower:
  Driving Layup: 92 (vs 98)
  Driving Dunk: 94 (vs 98)
  Agility: 69 (vs 77)
  Speed: 75 (vs 81)

Defense attributes higher:
  Block: 99 (vs 98)
  Interior Defense: 99 (same)
```

**Available Badges: 32 badges**
- Lost 2 Finishing badges due to lower mobility
- Gained slightly better shot blocking

**Analysis:** Taller centers sacrifice finishing and mobility for marginal defensive gains. Not worth the trade-off for badge optimization.

## Key Insights

### Height Impact
- **Shorter centers (6'9" - 6'10"):** Superior finishing attributes and mobility (Speed, Agility)
- **Taller centers (7'0"+):** Marginal defensive improvements, significant finishing penalties
- **Sweet spot:** 6'10" balances finishing, defense, and badge availability

### Wingspan Impact
- **Moderate wingspan (+0 to +4 inches):** Optimal badge availability
- **Long wingspan (+6+ inches):** Diminishing returns, may reduce some attributes
- **Sweet spot:** +2 to +4 inches over height

### Weight Impact
- **Light weight (220 lbs):** Better Speed and Agility
- **Heavy weight (260-280 lbs):** Better Strength, slightly worse mobility
- **Badge availability:** Minimal difference (32-34 badges across 220-280 lbs range)
- **Sweet spot:** 220-240 lbs for mobility-focused, 260+ lbs for physical play

### Badge Patterns
1. **Finishing dominates:** 19/34 badges (56%) are Finishing category
2. **Defense accessible:** 6 defense badges available even for offense-focused builds
3. **Playmaking strong:** 5 high-tier playmaking badges (3 Legendary)
4. **Rebounding limited:** Only 2 rebounding badges
5. **Secondary badges:** Many badges have ANY-attribute requirements, making them easier to unlock

## Methodology

**Data Source:** NBA2KLab API (real-time attribute caps)
**Attributes:** All 24 attributes provided by NBA2KLab

**Test Range:**
- Heights: 6'6" - 7'4" (78 - 88 inches, 1-inch increments)
- Wingspans: 6'6" - 7'8" (78 - 92 inches, 2-inch increments)
- Weights: 220 - 300 lbs (20 lb increments)
- Total builds tested: 200+

**Badge Calculation:**
- 64 badges from NBA2KLab data
- Each badge has Primary or Secondary attribute requirements
- Tiers: Legendary (💎), Hall of Fame (🥇), Gold (🥈), Silver (🥉), Bronze (🥉)
- Badge unlocks if ANY requirement threshold is met

## Next Steps

1. ~~**Integrate NBA2KLab API**~~ ✅ COMPLETE
2. ~~**Re-run optimization with full attribute set**~~ ✅ COMPLETE
3. **Test in-game** to validate findings against actual gameplay
4. **Compare to meta builds** from NBA 2K community (YouTube, Reddit)
5. **Test other positions** (Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward)
6. **Create build templates** with recommended badge selections
7. **Add build comparison feature** to CLI tool

## Raw Data

Top 10 builds by badge count (all 34 badges):

```
34 badges: 6'10" height, 7'2" wingspan, 220lbs  ⭐ OPTIMAL
